## dev-pack

The idea behind this project is to have a way to keep your online presence consistent across all social medias. 

For example: 
- name/handle
- blurb - max 160 characters
- social accounts
    - Twitter
    - dev.to
    - Github
    - LinkedIn
    - CodePen
    - StackOverflow
- domains
- media storage such as profile pictures
- resume

Those are the basics as of now which i will be working on. They are subject to change both in additions and subtractions.

All information will be accessible via a graphql endpoint or as simple copy paste or download. 

Login will be done via Github.
