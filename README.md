## dev-pack

The idea behind this project is to have a way to keep your online presence consistent across all social medias. 

For example: 
- name/handle
- short blurb
- long blurb
- social accounts
- domains
- media storage such as profile pictures, page photos, blog photos

Those are the basics as of now which i will be working on. They are subject to change both in additions and subtractions.

The site will be authenticated with each dev having there own database holding there information. The idea is somewhat vague at this point but I have an idea to possibly create a graphql api which this project will talk to and which will be built upon a database which will hold all the data. We will see, also subject to change.
